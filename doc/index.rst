====

Welcome to the `clutter` python package. The package provides research tools for testing reinforcement learning (RL) methods in robotic tasks, such as singulating a target object in clutter in order to grasp it. Simulation environments in pyBullet with a UR5 robotic arm and clutter scenes are provided along with RL agents.

Our main focus is to provide a **simple**, **modular** and **well documented** package which can be used and modified easily from the research community.

The source code can be found in our `github repository <https://github.com/robot-clutter/clutter>`_. If you have any issue or you want to propose a new feature, feel free to use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/robot-clutter/clutter/issues>`_ in the github repository. More information about relevant research and publications can be found in our `website <https://robot-clutter.github.io/>`_.
