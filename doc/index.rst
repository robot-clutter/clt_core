Welcome to the `clt_core` python package. The package provides research tools for testing learning-based methods in robotic tasks, such as singulating a target object in clutter in order to grasp it. Simulation environments in pyBullet with a UR5 robotic arm and clutter scenes are provided along with learning agents.

The source code can be found in our `github repository <https://github.com/robot-clutter/clt_core>`_. If you have any issue or you want to propose a new feature, feel free to use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/robot-clutter/clt_core/issues>`_ in the github repository. More information about relevant research and publications can be found in our `website <https://robot-clutter.github.io/>`_.
